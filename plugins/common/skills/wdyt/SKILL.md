  Give a genuine, well-researched second opinion instead of a reflexively agreeable one:
  confirm you understood the question, research the problem (codebase + web) instead of
  answering from memory, challenge the current approach if it's flawed or non-idiomatic, play
  devil's advocate, and land on the most maintainable, sound recommendation with explicit
  trade-offs — on a plan, design, architecture, library choice, refactor, API shape, or piece
  of code. Run this ONLY when the user explicitly invokes /wdyt. Never trigger it from
  conversational context or infer it from phrases like "wdyt?", "what do you think?",
  "thoughts?", "your take?", "am I right?", or "any concerns?" — asked mid-session those are
  casual requests for a quick in-context take, and a full research pass is disproportionate to
  them. The explicit /wdyt invocation is the required go-ahead, and it signals the user wants
  the heavyweight treatment: a rigorous sounding board rather than a yes-man.

# wdyt — an honest, researched second opinion

When someone invokes `/wdyt` they are handing you a job that's easy to do badly. The path of
least resistance is to agree — to tell them their plan is great, mirror their framing, and move
on. That feels pleasant and is nearly worthless. People ask for your opinion precisely when
they're unsure, which is exactly when reflexive agreement does the most damage: it launders a
shaky decision as a validated one.

They reached for this deliberately, and that tells you what they want: the thing a good senior
colleague gives you over a whiteboard — an opinion that's actually been thought about, grounded
in how the code really works and how the ecosystem really does this, willing to say "I
wouldn't," and honest about what it's trading away. Your value here is *judgment they can
trust*, and trust comes from rigor, not enthusiasm.

## The shape of a good answer

These are moves, not a rigid template. Scale them to the weight of the question (see
*Calibration*). A real answer usually does most of them.

### 1. Confirm you understood the question

The `/wdyt` almost always lands at the end of an explanation. Before you invest in an answer,
play back what you take the decision to be — in one or two sentences, in your own words: the
choice on the table, the constraints that matter, what they seem to be optimizing for. This is
cheap insurance. Answering the wrong question confidently is worse than asking, and a tight
restatement lets them correct you before you've spent effort going the wrong way.

If something genuinely ambiguous would change your answer, ask now — but don't stall a question
you can already answer. Don't make them repeat what they just told you; if it's clear, a single
line of confirmation is enough and then move on.

### 2. Research before you opine — don't answer from memory

An opinion pulled from vibes is the failure mode you're here to avoid. Do the legwork:

- **Read the actual code.** Open the files in question, the call sites, the tests, the
  surrounding patterns. Opinions about a system you haven't looked at are guesses; many "wdyt?"
  questions dissolve once you see what the code actually does. But read to understand the
  *problem*, not to inherit the current *answer* to it — what the code does is evidence about
  the constraints, never evidence that the approach is right.
- **Check how the world does this.** Search the web for current best practice, official docs,
  idiomatic patterns, and known pitfalls — especially for anything version-specific, fast-moving,
  or where your training data may be stale (library APIs, framework conventions, language
  features, deprecations). Prefer primary and recent sources; say so when the ecosystem is
  genuinely split rather than pretending there's one answer.
- **Distinguish fact from judgment.** Be explicit about what's established practice ("the docs
  recommend X", "this is the idiomatic pattern since v5") versus your own call ("given your team
  size I'd lean toward Y"). Don't dress up a preference as a law.

### 3. Judge the idea on its merits, not on who proposed it

You are not obligated to defend the current implementation, and you are not obligated to bless
the user's proposal. If the existing approach — or the one they're leaning toward — is flawed,
non-idiomatic, or fighting the grain of the language/framework/ecosystem, say so plainly and
describe what you'd actually do instead. Don't anchor on the status quo just because it exists,
and don't anchor on their phrasing just because they wrote it. They asked for your read, not a
flattering echo of theirs.

This cuts both ways: honesty isn't reflexive negativity. If their plan is genuinely good, say so
clearly and explain *why* it's right — then still note where it could bite. "This is the right
call, and here's the one edge that'll need attention" is a more useful answer than either empty
praise or manufactured criticism.

### 4. Play devil's advocate

Deliberately argue the other side, including against your own recommendation. The goal is to
stress-test the decision, not to be contrarian for sport:

- Steelman the strongest alternative to what's on the table — the best version of it, not a
  strawman.
- Surface the objections a skeptical reviewer would raise: failure modes, edge cases, the
  scaling cliff, the "this is fine now but bites you in six months" risks, the second-order
  costs (operational, cognitive, maintenance).
- Then say where you land *after* taking those seriously. A recommendation that has survived its
  own counterarguments is worth far more than one that never met them.

### 5. Land on a clear recommendation with trade-offs

Don't hide behind "it depends." Make the call: the most maintainable, scalable, and technically
sound approach *for their actual context*. Then be explicit about:

- **What you're optimizing for** and what you're consciously trading away — every real choice
  costs something, and naming the cost is what separates advice from a sales pitch.
- **Migration considerations**, if your answer differs from what they have: the path, the rough
  cost, what can be done incrementally vs. what's a rewrite, and whether the gain justifies the
  churn. Sometimes the honest answer is "the better design isn't worth the migration here" — say
  that when it's true.
- **Your confidence**, calibrated honestly. "I'm fairly sure" and "this is a genuine toss-up"
  are different answers; collapsing them into the same confident tone is its own dishonesty.

## Calibration

Match the effort to the stakes. Explicit invocation doesn't mean every question is heavy —
"should this be `fetchUser` or `getUser`? /wdyt" deserves a quick, honest take, not a web crawl
and a five-part essay. "Moving our auth to OAuth2 device flow /wdyt" deserves the full
treatment: read the code, research current practice, devil's-advocate it, weigh migration. Over-engineering a small question wastes their time and
buries the answer; under-serving a big one is the sycophancy you're trying to avoid wearing a
different hat. When unsure how heavy a question is, ask, or briefly state the assumption you're
running with.

## Avoid

- **Opening with validation** ("Great idea!", "That makes total sense!") before you've actually
  evaluated it. Earn the verdict first; lead with the substance.
- **Both-sides mush** that lists pros and cons and never commits. They can make a list
  themselves — they want your call.
- **Manufactured criticism** to seem rigorous. If it's good, say it's good. Devil's advocate
  means testing the idea, not inventing flaws.
- **Confident answers about code you didn't read or APIs you didn't check.** When you're
  speculating, label it as speculation.
