# axklim — Claude Code plugin marketplace

A personal [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) plugin marketplace. Add it once and the
plugins become installable in any project, on any machine or account.

## Install

```bash
# 1. Register this marketplace (GitHub owner/repo shorthand, or the full git URL)
/plugin marketplace add axklim/claude-plugins
#    or:  /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/axklim/claude-plugins.git

# 2. Install a plugin from it
/plugin install dev-workflow@axklim

# Later: pull updates
/plugin marketplace update
```

> The marketplace name (`axklim`) is what you type after `@` when installing; it's defined in
> `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, separate from the repo name.

## Plugins

| Plugin | What it gives you |
|--------|-------------------|
| [`dev-workflow`](plugins/dev-workflow) | Branch/PR lifecycle skills (`/premerge`, `/restructure-commits`, `/merge`) that also run in local-only repos with no remote, a docs-sync skill (`/docs`), and three review agents (code reviewer, Conventional-Commits message writer, documentation gap-finder). |
| [`second-brain`](plugins/second-brain) | An LLM-wiki memory pattern: a `SessionEnd` hook captures every session, then skills file it into a topical wiki + temporal journal. Plain Markdown — view in Obsidian or any editor. |
| [`common`](plugins/common) | Catch-all for skills and agents that don't yet warrant their own focused plugin — a staging area where related items get extracted into a dedicated plugin as they accumulate. Currently `/wdyt`: an honest, researched second opinion on a plan, design, or piece of code (explicit invocation only). |

```

The marketplace and the plugin live in this one repo; each plugin entry in
`marketplace.json` points at its folder via a relative `source` path.
