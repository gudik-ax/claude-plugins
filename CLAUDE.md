# Project conventions

Monorepo of Claude Code plugins under `plugins/<name>/`. Each plugin is self-contained and
versioned in `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

## Placing new skills and agents

Not every skill or agent justifies its own plugin. `plugins/common/` is the catch-all home for
items that don't yet belong to a focused plugin — park new skills/agents there instead of
spinning up a single-purpose plugin.

Before adding an item to `common`, check what's already parked there: if the new item plus some
existing ones form a coherent group (e.g. several advisory skills, or several review agents),
extract that group into a dedicated, well-named plugin rather than letting `common` sprawl.
`common` is a staging area, not a permanent dumping ground — graduating clusters out is the
whole point. Whenever you add a new plugin, register it in both `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
and the README plugin table.

## Gating skills on explicit invocation

Most skills should trigger from natural phrasing. Gate one behind explicit invocation only when
auto-firing would be **destructive** (rewrites history, merges to the trunk) or
**disproportionate** (kicks off a heavyweight research or review pass for what was a casual
aside). `/premerge`, `/restructure-commits`, `/merge`, and `/wdyt` are gated this way; `/docs`
deliberately isn't.

To gate a skill, write its frontmatter `description` so it names the command and refuses
conversational inference:

```
Run this ONLY when the user explicitly invokes /<name>. Never trigger it from conversational
context or infer it from phrases like "...", "...". The explicit /<name> invocation is the
required go-ahead.
```

Enumerating the phrases it must *not* fire on is the part that does the work — a bare "only when
invoked" leaves the model to guess what counts as an invocation.

## Version bumping

When you change a plugin, bump its `version` in `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as
part of the same change — don't leave it for a follow-up. Map the change's Conventional Commit
type to semver:

- `feat` → minor (e.g. `0.3.0` → `0.4.0`)
- `fix` / `docs` / `refactor` / `chore` → patch (e.g. `0.3.0` → `0.3.1`)
- a breaking change → major

Repo-level changes that touch no `plugins/<name>/` tree (root docs, meta) need no plugin bump.

## Opening a pull request

`origin` points at the upstream repo (`axklim/claude-plugins`), which most contributors can't
push to directly — pushing a branch there returns a `403`. Work through your fork instead: this
clone keeps a `fork` remote (`<your-account>/claude-plugins`). Push the feature branch to `fork`,
then open the PR from your fork into upstream `main`:

```
git push -u fork <branch>
gh pr create --repo axklim/claude-plugins --base main --head <fork-owner>:<branch>
```

`<fork-owner>` is the account that owns the `fork` remote. If you *do* have write access to
`origin`, push there and open the PR with the branch name alone (`--head <branch>`).
